# AlvinCassar_SWD6.2A_Project

Idea in simple terms: 
    Detect reef/bowline knots using yolov5

# In this repo you will find:
    YOLOv5_knots.ipynb - google collab notebook having all code to run collab
    train_data/images - file containing all the images for knots (around 400photos)
    train_data/labels - file containing all the labels for images - laballed using makesense.ai
    runs/train/exp100 - file containing all information when training algorithm with 100 epochs - including graphs and weights
    runs/train/exp60  - file containing all information when training algorithm with 60  epochs - including graphs and weights  
    runs/detect/exp   - file containing outputted images from the algorithm with labels and their %
